## On January 9th 2024, The OnlineMC repo and others have been DMCA striked by Mojang. This means OnlineMC will be gone forever along with the source code with it. But I found a fork of OnlineMC that I have to make it public.

Please go to the discord for bug reports.

# Do whatever you want to this repo, i dont really care because this is open source. If you encounter any bugs or problems, just dm me.

# radmanplays deployment links have been removed from README because the original deploy link connected to radman is linked to OnlineMC before the DMCA.
